# GraphQLRestructure

## Description

This project started as a full stack MERN application, and it was my job to restructure it to utilize GraphQL. 
The motivation behind this project was to demonstrate how GraphQL can be used to specify queries instead of using a full API call every time you want to do something.
As someone who does work on both the front and back end of these projects, I can see why GraphQL is a valuable tool to learn.

## Installation

Deployed at https://bookgraphql.herokuapp.com/

## Usage

User may login or create a new profile and search for any book in the google books API.  User may then add those books to their book list and access them from the navbar link.
